# Sprint 1. Maquetació I

## 📄 Description
The goal of this exercise is to understand and use different technologies available for web page layout. Therefore, the sprint is divided into 3 iterations:
- Implementation 1: Vanilla (HTML + CSS + JS)
- Implementation 2: Preprocessors (SASS)
- Implementation 3: Style Libraries (Tailwind)

To do this, a design is provided which must be replicated during each iteration with the appropriate technology.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this repository: `git clone`

## 🌐 Deployment
The deployed site is available at [GitHub Pages](https://mpujazon.github.io/1-Maquetacio-I/)

## 💭 Difficulties
Although this was a simple project, I struggled to position the decorative background elements. I realized the issue originated in the first phase because I didn't structure the HTML with the styling requirements in mind. I also had problems with image source paths: images appeared locally but were missing after deployment to GitHub Pages. I fixed this by using relative paths.

## 🧠 What I've learned
I improved my layout and HTML-structuring skills, practiced debugging asset paths for deployment, and gained confidence working with SASS and Tailwind.
